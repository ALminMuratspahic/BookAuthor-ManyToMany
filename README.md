# BookAuthor-ManyToMany
Tech used:
1.Spring Web
2.Java
3.JPA
4.MySQL for database
5.HTML,CSS,Thymeleaf

It is ManyToMany relationship in between Book and Author,and OneToOne relationship between Book and BookDetails.
In this project my goals was to achieve this relationship. So when i click on Book i want to se all Details about specific Book.
On the other side,i have list of Authors and all Books they wrote.
